<h3 style="text-align:center ;font:normal normal bold 48px/34px Poppins;letter-spacing: 0px;color: #4194CF;opacity:1;padding-top:1.3em">What Is A Pay Stub?</h3>
		<div class="row  mr-0">
			<div class="col-8 pt-4">
			  <p style="font-family:arial;line-height:2em;margin-left:4em">
			   		Simply put, a pay stub is a paper we keep after cashing our payroll checks. Not only does a pay stub serve as proof of income, it also helps you keep track of salary information, taxes paid, overtime pay and more.
			   	  </p>
			   	   	<p style="font-family:arial;line-height:2em;margin-left:4em"> A Paystub is a document usually given by an employer that outlines and details your pay (net pay- that is, the amount you take home) This paystub document lists and itemizes your salary/ wages earned for a specific set period. It also lists your taxes and other deductions taken out of your paycheck.
			   	   	   </p>
			   		       <p style="font-family:arial;line-height:2em;margin-left:4em"> A paystub document has many names and you can even use them interchangeably. A pay stub, pay slip, check stub, earnings statement or a paycheck stub all refer to the same document. An employee or an individual can create pay stubs online using the check stub maker or more commonly known as the paystub generator.
			   		            </p>
			   		             <p style="font-family:arial;line-height:2em;margin-left:4em;"> Depending on the state you reside in, a pay stub adheres to a certain set of rules. Some states mandate that a paystub must be printed and given to employees in hardcopy. Other states are not as stringent with their rules and allow employees to have an option of hard or soft copies of their paystub.

	    </h3>
	      <p style="font-family:arial;line-height:2em;margin-top: 2em;margin-left:4em;margin-right:4em">A paystub document is useful to both employers and employees.

Paycheck stubs are also used as proof of income or employment. We will be discussing this and the check stub maker further below.</p>
         <p style="font-family:arial;line-height:2em;margin-left:4em;margin-right:4em">Employers however will need pay stubs to settle any issues with their employees and ensure there are no discrepancies happening. Human resources and employers can also use pay stubs to fill in W2 forms come tax season.</p>
          <p style="font-family:arial;line-height:2em;margin-left:4em;margin-right:4em">As an individual, or employee you may be wondering why else you need your paystub? Does it come in handy in your day to day life? Long story short, Yes! Absolutely it does. Here are just a few instances below where you will need to show your paystub or prove your income.</p>

	</h5>
	  <p style="font-family:arial;line-height:2em;margin-left:4em;margin-right:5.5em;margin-top:2em;line-height:2em">Financial documents are not to be played with. Our financial lives get more and more complicated as we grow older and delve into new chapters of our lives. How does one figure out what documents to keep and for how long? For some documents, it makes sense to hold on to them while others, maybe not so much. Let's take your annual tax return, for instance, this should be filed and stored in a safe place. This rationale comes from the fact that the IRS can conduct a surprise audit if your income was under-reported for any reason. Such documents can come in handy and can save you in unprecedented times. Knowing that, it is no excuse for hoarding your documents either. Paystub documents are needed on so many occasions, for example, to prove your income or get a loan, etc. In a nutshell, it can be hard to determine how long to keep your paycheck stubs for, but one thing is for certain. Keep your pay stubs until you can at the very least verify the accuracy of the information on your W2 form.

Don't forget to safely shred documents that you want to dispose of. This prevents the possibility of fraud, scams, and identity theft.

	       <p style="font-family:arial;line-height:2em;margin-left:4em;margin-right:5.5em;margin-top:2em;line-height:2em">When seeking credit or loans, having a paystub on hand is required.

Our paystub creator is genuine, authentic and quite user friendly. With a small fee, you can create a paystub and get marching with confidence and no further delays. Unfortunately, there are many platforms out there that claim to be genuine, copying real pay stubs, charging a small fee and insisting that their service is real. Be cautious when choosing a check stub maker. Fake pay stubs and pay stub generators are becoming more and more common. How can one identify fake from real pay stubs anyway? That is the right question to ask. According to recent studies,many incomes reported and pay stubs filed turned out to be fake and the government is now honing down on these individuals and organizations. Instances such as unemployed people creating fake pay stubs or fake sources of income are on the rise. Filling in false information and showing it as proof. This is all to get a loan to secure an apartment or purchase a house or a vehicle. As tempting as this sounds it's not worth going through with it. Creating a fake document and sending it through to the government can get you in big trouble. If you're still wondering if it's illegal to make fake paystubs, then stop right here! It's truly not worth the trouble. If or should I say when you get caught, there are many repercussions. Here's a list of some of the problems you could face below.

There's so much to handle and so much to consider. Proof of income is just one of the many issues. How can a self employed individual show proof of income or their pay stubs? You can partially find the answer in your previous tax returns. Going through your tax returns can help you determine your income at a given period of time. This process however, does have a downside to the self employed individuals, wherein, certain small projects or off the books income may not have been recorded and this may not depict the full story of your income during that period. Keep in mind that independent contractors are self employed and receive a 1099 misc form.
