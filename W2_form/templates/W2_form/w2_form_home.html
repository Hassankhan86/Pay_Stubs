                <b style="font-size: 30px">What Is A W2 Generator?</b>
        </div>
        <p class="text-justify">Heard a lot about the W2 form but you can’t quite define it? What even is a W2 generator? Let’s answer these questions and more. A W2 form or W2 online is not just another tax document but one of the most important tax documents you need to present. A wage and tax statement sums up what a W2 online is all about. Essentially, a w2 generator is a tool used to calculate all your yearly wages alongside the federal and state taxes withheld from the paychecks.
            <br><br>
            Let’s delve deeper into the anatomy of a W2 form, its uses, and how to create a W2 online using a W2 creator or a W2 maker in a few easy steps.
            <br><br>
            Each paycheck you receive from your employer has income tax deductions subtracted from it. That is due to the fact that both federal and state governments impose income tax throughout the calendar year. This helps you understand just how much money was made and how much went to taxes in a specific set period. A W2 form received in January 2021 for instance, will reflect the income and deductions of the year 2020.
            <br><br>
            This form is usually sent out to employees either as a hardcopy or a W2 online no later than January 31st of each year unless of course, that falls on a weekend then it must be sent out on the very next business day. There is an exception to this as well. If you are an independent contractor or a freelancer, then you will need to fill out a 1099 misc form by yourself as that is not a form given out by an employer for your services.
            <br><br>
            A business owner must send out the W2 form to both the employee as well as the IRS. There’s not much to be done with your W2 once you receive it. To the IRS, the W2 form is also known as international return since it is sent out to the various parties, mainly the following.
        <ul style="margin-left: 100px">
            <li>The Federal Government</li>
            <li>The State</li>
            <li>The Employee</li>
        </ul>

                <p class="text-justify"><b style="font-size: 30px">What Does A W2 Form Look Like?</b>
                    <br><br>
                    So far it sounds quite discouraging doesn’t it? Let’s break it down a bit further.What does a W2 income statement look like? A form W2 contains a ton of boxes, each mentioning a portion of your earnings and withholdings. Being able to understand these boxes and their connotation allows you to properly and correctly convey the story on your tax return forms.
                    <br><br>
                    If in the case that your form W2 was mailed to you and you did not receive your W2 online, you can easily rip it open. You will notice numerous boxes filled with all sorts of information and abbreviations. Let’s take the acronym AGI for instance. Adjusted gross income or AGI is a formula best described as total gross income minus certain deductions. It is the first step towards finding your tax liability or how much you owe the government.
                    <br><br>
                    You can also use AGI to determine other deductions. Some, deduct medical expenses but you can only do that if your medical deductions exceed a certain percentage of your AGI. Find out more about AGI and how you can calculate it from your W2 form. Below you will find some of the boxes found on your W2 form discussed with their meaning at a glance.

If, by chance, you have given them several attempts to comply, but all in vain, you can raise this issue with the IRS and contact them directly at 800-829-1040.</p>

        <p>In a usual scenario, one would require a proof of income to file a tax return. What happens then to individuals who have both a form W2 online as well as a 1099 misc? What if you are a self-employed taxpayer but have received a W2 form in the past? This can increase the amount of stress on individuals as if tax season isn’t stressful enough but don’t worry, keep reading.</p>
        <p>A 1099 misc form is a document created by the IRS to support any income that does not come from a standard job. It serves as evidence that additional income has been made. Wondering which form to file? That is a very common question that has many answers but the short one is, file both your W2 & 1099 misc form. The more the merrier and the more documents you file, the better you stand with the IRS. It simply shows that you are being diligent and have nothing to hide.</p>
        <p>Unfortunately, all sources of income must be mentioned and filed accordingly. The good news is that if you receive both these forms, you probably won't owe as much money as someone who only receives a 1099. A self-employed individual or freelancer will have the headache of calculating how much they owe in taxes exactly as opposed to someone who receives a W2 online or a hardcopy.</p>

        </b></p>
        <p>Businesses, nonprofits, and public entities are all required to provide health insurance for their employees under a group health plan. This shows that they have complied with IRS regulations. If a business has less than 25 full-time employees, then they could be eligible for a small business healthcare tax credit. This is an initiative from the IRS to help with the cost of providing coverage.
        </p>
        <p>If however, the business has fewer than 50 full-time employees, then they may be eligible to buy coverage through the Small Business Health Option Program (SHOP). Employers must record employee healthcare benefits on the W2 form be it in hardcopy form or a W2 online within Box 12 with code DD.</p>
        <p>According to the AICPA, all business entities must report the total company health insurance cost of all group plans. Such group plans could include, self-insured, contributed a percentage to the employer, as well as employer sponsored health coverage. This includes direct, indirect or any other forms of health insurance.</p>
        <p>Individuals and family members must be aware that most states require Americans to have qualifying health insurance or at least the bare minimum. Enforcing this allows individuals with chronic conditions to not carry all of the burdens of the payment themselves. Each state has a different set of rules when it comes to healthcare. Make sure you are compliant with the healthcare laws of the state in which you reside. Find out how your healthcare plan affects your tax return in the various scenarios provided so you have a wholesome understanding of the topic and you don’t get duped easily.</p>

                What Are The Penalties To Watch Out For When Failing To Comply With The IRS?</h3>
            </b>

        </div>
        <p class="text-justify">
            Companies and business entities must watch out for the hefty penalties that could come crashing down on them if they are not compliant with the IRS rules and offer minimum essential healthcare coverage. Companies must provide proof of coverage for 95% of their employees and their dependents at any given month.
            <br><br>
            The IRS issues fines for every month that an employee has not received an offer of coverage. More dollars down the drain but it does not have to be this way. Fortunately, business owners can avoid the hassle and the daunting penalties by understanding the ACA reporting requirements and accurately reporting health insurance.
            <br><br>
            Large companies who do not comply with the ACA health coverage rule must pay a hefty sum. Employers are actually not required to calculate the shared responsibility payment on any tax return that they file. However, the IRS will mail them a paper listing all of their tax liability and provide them with an opportunity to respond or retaliate before they demand payment to be made.
            <br><br>
            As for individual penalties and fines, you must always check that you are in full compliance with the rules of the state you reside in as well as the IRS regulations or you will have to prepare to face some fines and strict penalties. Some of the most common penalties include:




        <ul style="margin-left: 80px">
            <li>Failure To File On Time Or By The Extension Time Granted</li>
            <li>Failure To Pay Taxes Reported And Owed In Full By Their Due Date Of April 15
            </li><li>Failure To Pay Unreported Tax Or In Other Words Did Not Pay Enough In Taxes</li>
            <li>Dishonored Check Due To Insufficient Funds</li>
        </ul>

Its purpose is to provide you, the IRS, the state and federal government with your income, tax, and deduction information. This helps the IRS determine whether you get a generous tax refund or possibly owe more in taxes. Let’s hope it’s the former one!
