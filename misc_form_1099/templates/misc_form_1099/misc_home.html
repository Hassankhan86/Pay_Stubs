            Payment items could include a rent payment received, royalties, awards, prizes, substitute payments instead
            of dividends. Most 1099 miscellaneous forms are known to be filled out mainly by independent contractors and

        </div>
        <p class="text-justify">
            Before attempting to fill in a 1099 form or create 1099 online, make sure to gather all the information you

            1099 Miscellaneous form include;
        <ul>
            <li>
                Full Name

        If you do freelance work regularly with 2 or more companies or clients then you need to produce each 1099 form.
        As a freelancer or independent contractor, just like any other standard employee, you must report all your
        earnings on your tax return. However, you would do it in a slightly different manner. As a self employed
        individual, you are responsible for medicare and social security tax payments.
        <br><br>

        You can calculate these figures using various schedules. In a nutshell, your net income information can be
        calculated on schedule C to know the amount of taxes you owe as a self employed individual for social security
        and medicare. While on the other hand schedule SE helps you calculate the total self employment tax amount. Do
        you feel that you still need more details on these schedules? Be sure to <a href="">check out this article from

        </div>
        <p class="text-justify">There are a few exceptions when reporting your income on a 1099 or 1099 online. Some
            payments need not be
            reported through a 1099, although they could be taxable. In that case, you would need to fill in other
            documents such as form W2 perhaps or a form 1098 even. Let’s explore some of these exceptions.</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Payments Made For Certain Commodities Such As A Telephone, Cargo, Storage, Or Any Other Such Related

                    have recently added a few new members to your staff, some part-timers or contractors perhaps.
                    <br><br>

                    Usually, your relationship with your contractors will be on a contract or project basis. These
                    individuals would be the ones receiving a 1099 form or creating a 1099 online once the project or
                    contract period has ended. It seems fairly easy, doesn’t it? Well, It can get quite complicated
                    though as some individuals are self-employed yet still work for a company full time. What does that
                    make them? Should independent contractors receive a pay stub or 1099 especially if they work close
                    to full-time hours?
                    <br><br>

                    Who receives a 1099, how they receive it and when, can vary depending on each individual situation.
                    It is not mandated by all states to send out a 1099 or a 1099 online but it is very much recommended

                    What Is The Difference Between A 1099 Misc And A W2 Form?
                </p>
            </div>
            <p class="text-justify">Many individuals complain that all these tax documents have many similarities. It is
                very understandable
                why one would think that, especially if they are not well versed with the financial and tax realm. That
                is precisely why we are here.

                We already uncovered that freelancers or contractors get paid differently to other employees, either on
                a per project basis or on contract terms. A traditional employee is a W2 employee and that means he/she
                has worked in the office for 20 hours a week at the very minimum, for a period of at least 3 months. If,
                however, you were given the option to work from home and get paid to complete a specific set of
                projects, then filling a 1099 form or 1099 online seems like a legit option.
                <br><br>

                As a contractor, if you have an obligation to show up at the office and stay for a specific number of
                hours, then you are by law classified as a W2 employee. It is a wise move to insist on your human
                resources department to classify you as a W2 employee in that case. Such an act will protect you from
                being taken advantage of by your employer or the company you work for. This can also save you time and
                money come tax filing time. <br><br>

                Don’t get fooled and make sure you know which category you fall under a W2 or 1099. If you are not
                knowledgeable on these things, you could very well be abused by the company and you wouldn't even know
                it. Create your W2 form with this online W2 generator!

            you have created or
            been given a 1099 online, and you have filled it out, here’s how to file 1099 online easily.
            <br><br>

            First, you need to make sure that you have several copies of your 1099 on hand so that you can send copies
            to the following concerned parties by or before January 31st at the very latest.

            <div class="col-md-9">
                <p class="text justify">Below are some of the ways you can file 1099, however that depends on how you

                    <br>

                    If you, as an independent contractor, have registered yourself as a company with a single member as
                    in, an LLC/Sole Proprietor, then your income is reported on a schedule C form. You need to remember
                    to add your 1099 income to all your other revenue sources and mention it on line 12 of your tax
                    return.
                    <br><br>

                    If in the instance that you have registered as a multi-member LLC or corporation, then your filing
                    methods will be a bit different. Rather than filling your 1099 under your personal income tax, you
                    would need to include it on your business tax return in the total income section.

            As a general rule or best practice, you as a contractor must keep a record of all your side jobs and gigs.
            This will help you be more financially organized and understand how much you’ve made, and how much you owe
            come tax time. If, in the unfortunate event that the IRS comes knocking on your door, you can have proof of

            There are many ways to stay financially organized and to track your earnings throughout the year. First off,
            you must get in the habit of capturing. To capture your receipts, invoices, and expenses is a difficult task

                <p class="text-justify">The million dollar question on everyone’s mind is how to reduce taxes,
                    especially on 1099 income. We
                    all know that you are obligated to pay self employment tax especially when your gross earnings for
                    the tax year hit around $400. On that principle, about 15.3% of your gross earnings go to taxes. No
                    one is thrilled about that.

                    That being said, there is light at the end of the tunnel. You could be entitled to certain tax
                    breaks. Let’s address the basics first.

                    Now that we’ve discussed up top, how you can track your income, you can now easily calculate your
                    gross income and your taxable income. Being up to date and staying on top of your earnings and
                    expenses will help you identify your tax bracket easily. This will allow you to pay exactly what you
                    owe and not over nor underpay.

        <p>Let’s talk about some of the deductible business expenses that you can avail of. If you have arranged or used
            any of the following on your business then you could be eligible for a higher deductible.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Advertising Costs
            </li>
            <li>Car Expenses Related To Your Business.</li>
            <li> Office Expenses, Stationery Supplies, Cleaning Services, Etc.</li>
            <li> Home Office Expenses, Such As Utility, Internet, Rent, And On Some Occasions Homeowner’s Insurance.
            </li>
            <li> Business Travel Expenses - Conference Costs, Flights, Hotels, Etc</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="text-justify">Keeping the receipts of all these things will help you have a business expense that is
            tax deductible. All
            you need to do come tax time is add up all of your expenses and file them as deductions.
            <br> <br>

            Self-employment tax gives you the benefit of being both, the employer as well as the employee. Doing so
            opens up doors for you to deduct business as well as personal expenses. We’ve discussed the business
            expenses, let’s talk now about your personal expenses. You have the liberty of deducting medical insurance
            costs for instance. They can be for you, your spouse or your children.
            <br><br>

            Here’s a bonus tip for you. Try and do the switch from a self employed company to a sole proprietorship
            business. Not only are they easy and cheap to form but you can also be eligible to form an S corporation to
            reap substantial tax benefits <br><br>

            Try and do your due diligence in keeping up with financial news and updates but it is understandable that
            some things may slip right through you. If you have the budget and can afford to do so, it is recommended
            that you hire a tax attorney specialist. He/She would be more knowledgeable in the ins and outs of the tax
            realm and the relevant provisions of the tax code. Yes, it would be an added expense to you but it can also
            hold its rewards as he/she could help you get more deductions than you would have previously thought. That’s
            a bonus by itself!
